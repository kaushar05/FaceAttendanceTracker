**Conclusion **
Automated Facial Recognition System The attendance system is straightforward, accurate and efficient efficaciously. 
This system works automatically when every student's registration is created by the administrative power.
It is necessary to use few algorithms which can perceive appearances to improve the performance of the system and the accuracy of the recognition.
This technology has the potential to greatly reduce the time and resources required for manual attendance tracking, and also can provide a high level of security and prevention of cheating.
With the integration of other systems, mobile support, increased security and adaptability to different settings, the future scope of such systems looks very promising. Additionally, 
the cost efficiency of this technology can make it more accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses.
